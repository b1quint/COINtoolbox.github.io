An unstructured and intimate meeting,  offering opportunities for collaborative research, learning, and sharing of expertise with concrete scientific outcomes.
 
The main goal of the CRPs is to benefit  young and experienced researchers in astronomy, statistics and computer science alike. Thus contributing to the establishment of Astrostatistics as a discipline on its own. 
 
We also aim at creating a personal bound among our members, provinding a completely informal environment where such intimate connections can grow. 
Thus, the program is held in a residence and participants share not only scientific discussions, but participate in logistic decisions during the program.
