Statistical methods play a central role  to fully exploit astronomical
catalogues and an  efficient  data analysis requires astronomers to go beyond
the traditional Gaussian-based models. This projects illustrates the power of
generalized linear models (GLMs) for astronomical community, from a Bayesian
perspective.  Applications range from modeling star formation activity
(logistic regression), globular cluster population (negative binomial
regression), photometric redshifts (gamma regression), exoplanets multiplicity
(Poisson regression), and so forth.
