Statistical methods play a central role  to fully exploit astronomical
catalogues and an  efficient  data analysis requires astronomers to go beyond
the traditional Gaussian-based models. This projects illustrates the power of
generalized linear models (GLMs) for astronomical community, from a Bayesian
perspective.  Applications range from modeling star formation activity
(logistic regression), globular cluster population (negative binomial
regression), photometric redshifts (gamma regression), exoplanets multiplicity
(Poisson regression), and so forth.

 This interface provides a simple control for the R version of the CosmoPhotoz
 code. Beyond offering the control of the most used functionalities of the code,
 this interface provides graphical overviews of the results for diagnostics of
 the method (each tab is a different graphical representation of the analysis
 result).
