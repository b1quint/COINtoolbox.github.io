Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) enables the statistical analysis of
stochastic models for complex physical systems in cases where the true
likelihood function is unknown, unavailable, or computationally expensive.
ABC relies on the forward simulation of mock data rather than the
specification of a likelihood function.  The CosmoABC code was originally
designed for cosmological parameter inference from galaxy clusters number counts
based on Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich measurements. Nevertheless, the user can easily take
advantage of the ABC sampler along with his/her own simulator, as well as test
personalized prior distributions, summary statistics and distance functions.
