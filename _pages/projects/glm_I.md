Statistical methods play a central role  to fully exploit astronomical
catalogues and an  efficient  data analysis requires astronomers to go beyond
the traditional Gaussian-based models. This projects illustrates the power of
generalized linear models (GLMs) for astronomical community, from a Bayesian
perspective.  Applications range from modeling star formation activity
(logistic regression), globular cluster population (negative binomial
regression), photometric redshifts (gamma regression), exoplanets multiplicity
(Poisson regression), and so forth.

 Suited to handle binary or proportional  data, also called absence and presence
 data. For example AGN activity, star-galaxy separation, fraction of bars in a
 galaxy, scape fraction, etc.
