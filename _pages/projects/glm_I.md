Statistical methods play a central role  to fully exploit astronomical
catalogues and an  efficient  data analysis requires astronomers to go beyond
the traditional Gaussian-based models. This projects illustrates the power of
 generalized linear models (GLMs) for astronomical community, from a Bayesian
 perspective.  Applications range from modeling star formation activity
 (logistic regression), globular cluster population (negative binomial
 regression), photometric redshifts (gamma regression), exoplanets multiplicity
 (Poisson regression), and so forth.
